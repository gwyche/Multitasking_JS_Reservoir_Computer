# Multitasking_JS_Reservoir_Computer

Summary:
5 reservoir computers running in parallel in JS. 1 L reservoir and 2 L MLP per reservoir computer.
The program outputs an array containing the final learning errors calculated by each of the 5 reservoir computers.
///////

To Install:

package.json and 2LNN Classes.js need to be put in a folder named neural, which needs to be placed into your node-modules folder.

You will also need to install the async third party plugin using the command:
npm i async
///////

To Run:
Open the file master.js and run it in node or your js program of choice.
///////

End Goal:
Future iterations will employ double this number of neural nets and will utilize a common csv file for the passing of inputs and outputs between NNs. Ultimately, this project will evolve into the guidance system for a lego car.
